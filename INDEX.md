## Welcome

This repository contains my **weekly coursework journal** for the Operating Systems module.

The purpose of this journal is to document, step by step, the practical work carried out across the semester.  
Each week focuses on a specific topic such as system planning, security configuration, performance testing, monitoring, and final system hardening.

All work has been completed using a Linux-based virtualised environment and is supported with:
- Command-line outputs
- Configuration files
- Screenshots as evidence
- Structured explanations
- Weekly reflections
