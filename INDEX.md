## Welcome

This repository contains my **weekly coursework journal** for the Operating Systems module.

The purpose of this journal is to document, step by step, the practical work carried out across the semester.  
Each week focuses on a specific topic such as system planning, security configuration, performance testing, monitoring, and final system hardening.

All work has been completed using a Linux-based virtualised environment and is supported with:
- Command-line outputs
- Configuration files
- Screenshots as evidence
- Structured explanations
- Weekly reflections

## Assessment Mapping (How this journal meets the brief)

This journal is structured across Week 1 to Week 7, matching the coursework phases:

- **Week 1:** System planning, architecture, network plan, and CLI specification evidence  
- **Week 2:** Security baseline planning, threat model, and testing methodology  
- **Week 3:** Workload/application selection and monitoring strategy  
- **Week 4:** SSH hardening (keys), firewall restriction, and user privilege management (SSH-only admin)  
- **Week 5:** AppArmor/SELinux, automatic security updates, fail2ban, and required scripts  
- **Week 6:** Performance testing with data tables + graphs, bottleneck analysis, and optimisation (before/after)  
- **Week 7:** Security audit (Lynis + nmap), service audit, remediation evidence, and remaining risk assessment  

All system administration and configuration tasks were performed remotely using **SSH from the workstation**, in line with the coursework administrative constraint.

## Final Note

This journal reflects my understanding of operating system concepts through hands-on configuration, testing, and evaluation.  
Decisions made throughout the coursework are justified based on security, performance, and best practice considerations.
